# blockchain-mockup

A simple blockchain mockup made in order to get myself familiar with the technology's key concepts.

It simulates the mining process in a multithreaded environment and allows for users to send data, as well as for miners 
to create new blocks, which are added to the blockchain, given that the hash is correct.
